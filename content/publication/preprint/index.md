abstract: Even though digitally filtered images are taking over the Internet for their aesthetic appeal, general people often feel betrayed if they are dealt with filtered images. Our study, comprising a series of structured surveys over images filtered using Instagram filters, reveals that different people perceive the filtered images differently. However, people have a common need for an automated tool to help them distinguish between original and filtered images. Accordingly, we develop an automated tool named ‘InnerEye’, which is capable of identifying how far an image is filtered or not. InnerEye utilizes a novel analytical design of a Neural Network Model that learns from a diverse set of images filtered using Instagram filters. Rigorous objective and subjective evaluations confirm the efficacy of InnerEye in identifying the extent of filtering in the images.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study examines the interaction with and identification of images filtered using Instagram filters, culminating in the development of an automated tool, InnerEye, for detecting the extent of image filtering.
