Developed an automated brain tumor image segmentation pipeline, incorporating Anisotropic Filtering for denoising, contrast
enhancement, and skull removal, resulting in a remarkable 11.58% increase in precision and a minor 0.1% accuracy
improvement when compared to the state-of-the-art method for brain tumor segmentation employing adaptive filtering.
